# Galaxy Trucker - Java Implementation

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Java-based implementation of the popular board game Galaxy Trucker, developed at
Politecnico di Milano for the final exam of Software Engineering (Ingegneria del Software).

Galaxy Trucker is a strategic board game where players build spaceships from tiles and then fly them through dangerous
space, facing various challenges like meteors, pirates, and equipment failures. This digital implementation faithfully
recreates the complete game experience with both network multiplayer support and multiple user interface options.

### Team Members

- Gabriele Crimella
- Anna Cordioli
- Erica Donno
- Davide Faccini

## Features

The implementation includes:

- **Complete game rules** with all original mechanics
- **Network multiplayer support** via both RMI and Socket connections
- **Dual interface options**: Textual User Interface (TUI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **Two additional functionalities**: Test Flight mode and Multiple Games support


## How to Run

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The provided JAR files have been tested and verified to work only on Windows systems.
Compatibility with other operating systems (e.g., macOS, Linux) is not guaranteed and may result in unexpected behavior
due to platform-specific dependencies or file handling.

The project consists of two main JAR files:

- `IS25-AM02-1.0-server-win.jar` - Game Server
- `IS25-AM02-1.0-client-win.jar` - Game Client

### Starting the Server

```bash
java -jar IS25-AM02-1.0-server-win.jar
```

### Starting the Client

```bash
java -jar IS25-AM02-1.0-client-win.jar [network-protocol] [interface-type] [server-ip]
```

**Parameters:**

- **network-protocol**: Connection type
    - `rmi` - RMI (Remote Method Invocation) connection
    - `socket` - TCP Socket connection
- **interface-type**: User interface mode
    - `tui` - Textual User Interface (command-line based)
    - `gui` - Graphical User Interface (JavaFX based)
- **server-ip**: IP address of the game server

**Example usage:**

```bash
# Connect with GUI via RMI to localhost
java -jar IS25-AM02-1.0-client-win.jar rmi gui 127.0.0.1

# Connect with TUI via Socket to remote server
java -jar IS25-AM02-1.0-client-win.jar socket tui 192.168.1.100

# Connect with GUI via Socket to localhost
java -jar IS25-AM02-1.0-client-win.jar socket gui localhost
```

## Network Configuration

The application supports two network protocols:

### RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

- **Parameter**: `rmi`
- Java's built-in distributed computing mechanism
- Suitable for Java-to-Java communication

### Socket Connection

- **Parameter**: `socket`
- TCP-based communication
- More universal and firewall-friendly

## User Interface Options

### Textual User Interface (TUI)

- **Parameter**: `tui`
- Command-line based interface
- Lightweight and suitable for headless environments
- Full game functionality through text commands

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- **Parameter**: `gui`
- JavaFX-based graphical interface
- Intuitive visual gameplay
- Enhanced user experience with animations and visual feedback

## Additional Features

Beyond the core game implementation, we have successfully developed:

1. **Complete Rules Implementation** - Full faithful recreation of the original Galaxy Trucker board game mechanics
2. **Dual Interface Support** - Both TUI and GUI options for different user preferences
3. **Network Connectivity** - Both RMI and Socket-based multiplayer support
4. **Test Flight Mode** - Practice mode for players to familiarize themselves with ship building
5. **Multiple Games Support** - Ability to host and manage multiple concurrent game sessions

## Requirements

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 23 or higher
- Network connectivity for multiplayer gameplay
- For GUI mode: JavaFX-compatible system

## Development

This project demonstrates advanced software engineering concepts including:

- Network programming (RMI and Socket)
- GUI development with JavaFX
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
- Multithreading and concurrent programming
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Client-server architecture

## Important Notes on the Project

The test coverage percentage for the `model` package currently stands at **62%**.  
While this value may appear modest, it is a direct consequence of the architectural responsibilities assigned to the
package.
Specifically, the `model` layer is tasked with broadcasting a considerable number of state updates to connected clients,
which are essential to guarantee correct and dynamic game interaction. These update mechanisms are inherently
interactive and network-dependent, and as such, they cannot be effectively tested in isolation using standard **JUnit**
procedures.
Consequently, the coverage rate reflects the structural necessity of coupling with remote clients, rather than a lack of
testing rigor or oversight.

## Copyright

Due to copyright all assets are removed from the game, to make it playable it requires the user to import them directly,
all rights to the assets and the game rules are owned by Cranio Creations srl. For this reason precompiled jars are also
unavailable.
